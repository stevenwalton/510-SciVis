\frametitle{Methodology}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generative based machine learning models are a promising avenue
            for time-series upscaling.
        \item Attention based networks are shown to be highly parallelizable and
            able to "remember" features through time-series data. 
        \item Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are computationally efficient and
            have proven effective in working with images.
        \item Model uses CNNs, skip layers, and self-attention to generate
            time-series upscalling.
